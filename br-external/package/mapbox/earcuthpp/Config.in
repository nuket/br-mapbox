	  C++ earcut.hpp Header

	  A C++ port of earcut.js, a fast, header-only polygon triangulation library.

	  The library implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by z-order 
          curve hashing and extended to handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies 
          and self-intersections in a way that doesn't guarantee correctness of 
          triangulation, but attempts to always produce acceptable results for practical 
          data like geographical shapes.
